Certain APIs may only make sense when dynamically rendering.\n * Traditionally this meant deopting the entire render to dynamic however with PPR we can now deopt parts\n * of a React tree as dynamic while still keeping other parts static. There are really two different kinds of\n * Dynamic indications.\n *\n * The first is simply an intention to be dynamic. unstable_noStore is an example of this where\n * the currently executing code simply declares that the current scope is dynamic but if you use it\n * inside unstable_cache it can still be cached. This type of indication can be removed if we ever\n * make the default dynamic to begin with because the only way you would ever be static is inside\n * a cache scope which this indication does not affect.\n *\n * The second is an indication that a dynamic data source was read. This is a stronger form of dynamic\n * because it means that it is inappropriate to cache this at all. using a dynamic data source inside\n * unstable_cache should error. If you want to use some dynamic data inside unstable_cache you should\n * read that data outside the cache and pass it in as an argument to the cached function.\n */\n\nimport type { WorkStore } from '../app-render/work-async-storage.external'\nimport type {\n  WorkUnitStore,\n  RequestStore,\n  PrerenderStoreLegacy,\n  PrerenderStoreModern,\n  PrerenderStoreModernRuntime,\n} from '../app-render/work-unit-async-storage.external'\n\n// Once postpone is in stable we should switch to importing the postpone export directly\nimport React from 'react'\n\nimport { DynamicServerError } from '../../client/components/hooks-server-context'\nimport { StaticGenBailoutError } from '../../client/components/static-generation-bailout'\nimport {\n  getRuntimeStagePromise,\n  throwForMissingRequestStore,\n  workUnitAsyncStorage,\n} from './work-unit-async-storage.external'\nimport { workAsyncStorage } from '../app-render/work-async-storage.external'\nimport { makeHangingPromise } from '../dynamic-rendering-utils'\nimport {\n  METADATA_BOUNDARY_NAME,\n  VIEWPORT_BOUNDARY_NAME,\n  OUTLET_BOUNDARY_NAME,\n  ROOT_LAYOUT_BOUNDARY_NAME,\n} from '../../lib/framework/boundary-constants'\nimport { scheduleOnNextTick } from '../../lib/scheduler'\nimport { BailoutToCSRError } from '../../shared/lib/lazy-dynamic/bailout-to-csr'\nimport { InvariantError } from '../../shared/lib/invariant-error'\nimport { RenderStage } from './staged-rendering'\n\nconst hasPostpone = typeof React.unstable_postpone === 'function'\n\nexport type DynamicAccess = {\n  /**\n   * If debugging, this will contain the stack trace of where the dynamic access\n   * occurred.
